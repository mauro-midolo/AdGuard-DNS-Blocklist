# Malicious DNS Blocklist for AdGuard Home

Welcome to the repository of my custom DNS blocklist for use with AdGuard Home. This list has been curated to filter and block specific unwanted domains, providing an additional layer of security and privacy to your network.

## Instructions:
1. **Copy the list link**
   Copy the link of the DNS blocklist: [link](https://mauro-midolo.github.io/AdGuard-DNS-Blocklist/assets/filter_1.txt)

2. **Open AdGuard Home**
   Access your AdGuard Home interface.

3. **Navigate to Settings**
   Go to the "Settings" section of AdGuard Home.

4. **Add the List**
   Find the option to add a new blocklist and paste the copied link.

5. **Save Changes**
   Save the changes and restart AdGuard Home to apply the new DNS blocklist.

Now you can browse more securely, protecting your network from online attacks. Contribute to the list's improvement by suggesting new malicious domains through repository issues. Join the community for safer and more private browsing!
